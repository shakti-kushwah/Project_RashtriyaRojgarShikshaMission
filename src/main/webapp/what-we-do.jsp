	                	Eradicating child labour prevalent in the capital of India, New Delhi, was the core of Rashtriya Rojgar 
	                	Shiksha Mission vision in 2009. What started off with evening classes for these children has now grown into several 
	                	initiatives ranging from residential schools to higher education support. We help not only child- and bonded labourers 
	                	but also school dropouts and children who were never enrolled in schools.Our exercise of strengthening the education 
	                	system in New Delhi has expanded and today we are a pan-Indian NGO working with children.The aim of this intervention 
	                	is to ensure education for all children by bringing them out of the vicious circle of poverty through a spectrum of 
	                	activities.

		                initiatives – through medical camps, sanitation and hygiene management, maternal and child health initiatives and 
		                infrastructure upgrades. In Kancheepuram, we have established a model clinic and pharmacy that offer superior medical 
		                services at affordable rates. Effective public-private partnerships and facilitating Government schemes help us to 
		                empower the community. In addition to these interventions, we have conducted several research studies for UN agencies 
		                with the help of our robust monitoring and evaluation team, paired with a team of experts in public health.among youth,

	                	in 2012 to deal with the waste menace faced by communities. The SWM wing creates end-to-end solutions to manage 
	                	waste generated by urban and rural areas. Our  goal is to reduce the waste that is being used as landfills.
